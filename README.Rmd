Overview
------------

`reppear` package belongs to the `pearsonverse` - set of packages which facilitates the data science process in R. The main goal of this package is to support teams via __building a reproducible report with standardised layout__.


## Installation

First install `pearsonverse` [package](https://github.com/pearsonplc/pearsonverse). It will install all `*pear` packages.

```{r, warning = F, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("pearsonplc/pearsonverse")
```

However, if you want to install just `reppear` package:

```{r, warning = F, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("pearsonplc/reppear")
```

## Goals

### Building a reproducible report

`report_create(file, subdir = "reports")` - a function which builds the report skeleton in specific path (defined in `subdir` argument). By default, it is created in `reports` folder. When your `subdir` does not have any file, `report_create` function will create following structure:  

```{r, eval=F}
report_create("01_report")
```

```{r,echo = F}
data <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  package = c("reports", "01_report", "_header.html","_tooltip_content.html", 
              "index.Rmd", "01_report.Rmd", "deps"),
  dependencies = I(list(
    c("01_report", "_header.html","_tooltip_content.html", "index.Rmd"),
    c("01_report.Rmd","deps"),
    character(0), character(0), character(0), 
    character(0), character(0)
  ))
)

cli::tree(data, root = "reports")
```

__Report structure__

Let's go thorugh each of the component:

- `01_report` -  a directory which stores a report and all its dependendies.
- `_header.html` - a file which stores a header for the home page and each report. It attaches data from index.Rmd thus it should never be edited by hand.
- `_tooltip_content.html` - a file which stores tooltip text used in the report. It attaches data from index.Rmd thus it should never be edited by hand. 
- `index.Rmd` - a file which acts as a home page for all reports within the project. More info about the file structure below.

You can then go to `01_report/01_report.Rmd` and start adding R code to build your report. After that, use `Knit` button to compile it to `01_report.html` file.

Once you have a basic structure like above, every time you use `report_create` function, it will build only one directory with another report. For example:

```{r,eval=F}
report_create("02_report")
```

will only create a `02_report` directory with the same structure as `01_report` (`.Rmd` file and `deps` subdirectory).

__`index.Rmd` file__

`index.Rmd` is a home page for all reports related to our project. It has fixed layout and you can manipulate its content using predefined variables in this file:

```{r, eval = F}
title: # you define your project title.
intro: # introduction to the project. Could be a few sentences.
author_email: # define author emails. Use comma separator to add more than one email.
bitbucket_url: # It should automatically add it if you init git thus it should never 
# be edited by hand.

finding: # list of main findings (once you ready to finalise your project).
  - name: # a crucial sentense about your main finding the report.
    link: # link to the report.
  - name: # another finding summarised the report.
    link: # link to the report.

in_progress: # list of linked reports produced during the project.
  - name: # report title (presented as a button label).
    link: # a link to the report.

appendix: # list of linked reports produces during the project.
  - name: # report title (presented as a button label).
    link: # a link to the report.

thanks: # acknowledgement.
  - name: # colleague name.
    forwhat: # for example, "for helping to understand the data."

```

Data Science Workflow
------------

This template was designed with the reader in mind. It aims at communicating the results in the most readable way possible. It should support two appoaches of collaborating with stakeholders:

- seldom collaboration
- continuous collaboration

Below, the latter approach was described in terms of using `index.Rmd` file:

1. At the begging of your project you should build a report template by using `report_create` function.
2. After you finished a first report, you should define following attributes in `index.Rmd` file:

```{r,eval=F}
title: 
intro: 
author_email: 
in_progress: 
  - name: 
    link: 
```

All reports you produce should be listed in `in_progress` attribute using both `name` and `link` attribute. No other attributes are needed.

3. Once you ready to finalise your whole project, you should choose the most important insights (and associated reports) and put them in `finding` attribute. The rest reports, which don't include important findings for the final reader should go to the `appendix` attribute. Then, remove `in_progress` attribute. Finally, add `thanks` attribute.


```{r, eval = F}
title: 
intro: 
author_email: 

finding: 
    - name: 
      link: 
    - name: 
      link: 

appendix:
  - name:
    link:

thanks: 
  - name: 
    forwhat: 

```

__Addidional features of `index.Rmd` file__

You can also define tooltip text.For example, by adding this chunk of code in `index.Rmd`,

```{r, eval=F}
tooltip:
- name: mpg
  descr: Miles per Gallon - measure of the vehicle's fuel consumption commonly used in 
        the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
```

Once your tooltip is defined and render it by `render_index()` function (which re/builds `index.html`, `_tooltip_content.html` and `_header.html` files), you can use it in any markdown document any number of times by simply adding a span html element directly into the text like that:

```{r,eval=F}
<span class = "tooltipster tooltip-mpg">MPG</span>
```

The class argument is crucial for the tooltip to be displayed properly.
 
```{r,eval=F}
'Economy of the car decreases by 5.3 <span class = "tooltipster tootlip-mpg">MPG</span></span>
with each additional ton of car weight (on avg.). However, the decrease ...'
```

Few tips on how to write tooltips:    
- Try to keep the message short and informative.      
- Don’t repeat every tooltip each time given phrase is used. Placing it on the first occurrence of in each paragraph it’s used or sections should be enough.
